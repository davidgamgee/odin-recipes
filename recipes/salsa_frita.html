        <p>
            <em>This Salsa from a family in Oaxaca demonstrates the strong spanish 
                influence on a lot of Mexican food. the grassy flavor and heat of 
                the serrano chiles is very Mexican, but the chiles are fried (a technique 
                that the Spanish brough to the New World) and the mayonnaise-like emulsion
                you end up with is similar to what the Spanish call aioli (and the French call 
                a√Øoli). Originally pounded painstakingly in a mortar and pestle, tis smooth, 
                almost creamy chile sauce is turned out wonderfully by the blender"</em>
